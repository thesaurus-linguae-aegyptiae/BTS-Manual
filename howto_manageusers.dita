  <title>Manage users and user groups</title>
  <body>
    <p>This function is available to the user with global administrator privileges only. </p>
    <p>To open the user management select "Open User Manager" from the drop-down menu "Preferences"
      of the menu bar. Clicking on this menu entry opens the window "User Management". Select the
      tab: "Manage Users and User Groups".</p>
    <p>The tab "Manage Users and User Groups" offers the opportunity to create new accounts for
      users and add users to project groups, which have a specific set of rights in the editing
      process.</p>
    <p>In the tab <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/users.png" id="image_m5r_q5k_4r"/> "Active
      Users" the active user groups are displayed. In the tab "Trash", deleted user groups are shown.
      In the brackets behind the group names the number of the assigned users is displayed. Clicking
      on a group name will open the list of assigned users. The last entry in the list "_Orphans"
      shows all available users. </p>
    <p>Each group has an ID and a name which appear in the field on the right. For each group a type
      can also be given and there is a possibility to write a comment. Also on the right side, below
      the group data, there is a section for creating new individual members within the group:
      "Create New User". A username and a password are to be entered while creating a new user. In
      the third section below there is a drop-down menu, where you can choose existing users and add
      them to the group by clicking on "Add user to Group".</p>
    <p>Clicking on a username allows to modify the user information on the right side of the window.
      It contains such fields as "ID of User", "Forename", "Surname", "Email", "Website",
      "Description", "Web Description", "Siglum", and "Comment". In the ID field a username given
      earlier appears, but cannot be edited anymore. The check box "User is Database Administrator"
      can be checked. Required fields are marked by an asterisk (*).</p>
