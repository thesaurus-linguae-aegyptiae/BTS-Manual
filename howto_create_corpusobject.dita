  <title>Creating and modifying a database object (Text Corpus Object and Text)</title>
  <body>
    <p>The following functions are available to users with at least Researcher rights for a given
      corpus. Creating a Text Corpus Object (TCObject) and a Text are the basic steps for entering
      and editing a text in BTS. Before creating a Text you need to define the physical source of
      that text by creating a TCObject, which is the object on which your text is inscribed. Texts
      and TCObjects are therefore in a child-parent relationship, i.e. a Text is always linked to a
      specific TCObject, not vice-versa (see also <xref href="intro_ui_glossary.dita"/>).</p>
    <p><b>Creating a Text Corpus Object</b></p>
    <p>
      <ol id="ol_zxm_3ty_qt">
        <li>Choose the corpus from the Corpus Navigator tree which you want your TCObject to belong
          to. You can either add an TCObject directly to a corpus or to another already existing
          TCObject within that corpus. Even though you can move database objects at a later date
          (see below), this process takes time and so try to maintain a logical organisation from
          the start (see image below).<p>NOTE: New database objects are physically saved in your
            main working corpus (which you selected in the <xref href="ui_berlintextsystem.dita"
              >preferences</xref> option during installation), regardless of which corpus you chose
            in step 1. New database objects will appear in the corpus you chose in the Navigator
            Tree, but will not be physically saved there; positions in this Tree depend on the
            relationships between the database objects, not on their physical storage
          location.</p></li>
        <li>Once you have selected your corpus/TCObject, click "Add Text Corpus Object". The newly
          created TCObject has the relation "PartOf" to the chosen corpus/TCObject. </li>
        <li>Name your Text Corpus Object in the <xref href="ui_maintab.dita#concept_isp_k5f_yr">Main
            Tab </xref> of the Passport Editor (The "Name" input field will appear red). You can do
          this later if you prefer, but until it is named the object will appear in the Navigator
          Tree with the default name "BTSTC Object".</li>
        <li>Define the Type of the TCObject (there are no Subtypes, this field should not be used).
          Overall try to provide as much information as possible about the object by filling out the
          different tabs of the <xref href="ui_passporteditor.dita">Passport Data Editor</xref>. The
          different Types are as follows:<p>
            <ul id="ul_c1c_qgp_3x">
              <li><image href="Images/Icons_updated/full/icon16/caption.png" id="image_d3w_d3p_3x"/>
                <b>Caption:</b> The Caption is used to group physical objects under one heading for
                pragmatic reasons (e.g. the stelae from Kawa or the medical papyri).</li>
            </ul>
            <ul id="ul_gtb_xwp_3x">
              <li><image href="Images/Icons_updated/full/icon16/group.png" id="image_o42_c3p_3x"/>
                <b>Group:</b> A Group defines a number of physical objects which belong together for
                geographic reasons (e.g. the tombs of a specific cemetery like the Eastern Cemetery
                at Giza or a papyrus archive like the Abusir Papyri).</li>
            </ul>
            <ul id="ul_gqd_xwp_3x">
              <li><image href="Images/Icons_updated/full/icon16/arrangement.png"
                  id="image_isy_c3p_3x"/>
                <b>Arrangement:</b> An Arrangement defines a closed association of finds (e.g. the
                objects from the tomb of Tutankhamun or the objects from a foundation deposit).</li>
            </ul>
            <ul id="ul_q3f_xwp_3x">
              <li><image href="Images/Icons_updated/full/icon16/scene.png" id="image_hjy_t5p_3x"/>
                <b>Scene:</b> This is an obsolete entry that was used for data imported from the
                previous system. Do not use it.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul id="ul_egh_xwp_3x">
              <li><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/tcobject.png" id="image_nw4_yhp_3x"/>
                <b>TCObject:</b> A Text Corpus Object is the physical ancient Egyptian object that
                is covered with your text (e.g. the Papyrus Harris 500 or the sphinx stele of
                Thutmose IV). Use this option if none of the other types are applicable.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul id="ul_obj_xwp_3x">
              <li><image href="Images/Icons_updated/full/icon16/tcobjectpart.png"
                  id="image_tpj_b3p_3x"/>
                <b>ObjectPart:</b> An ObjectPart is hierarchically subordinated to another TCObject.
                Use this option when the carrier of your text consists of more than one physical
                object (e.g. a statue and its base, or several parts of a building).</li>
            </ul>
          </p></li>
      </ol>
    </p>

        id="image_tbm_bfq_3x"/></p>
    <p><b>Creating a Text</b></p>
    <p>
      <ol id="ol_z4r_kty_qt">
        <li>Select <xref href="intro_ui_glossary.dita"> a node</xref> in the Corpus Navigator where
          you'd like to place your Text. You can either add a Text to a TCObject or to an already
          existing Text. </li>
        <li>Click <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/text-add.png" id="image_eyb_bty_qt"/> "Add
          Text" in the Corpus Navigator toolbar. A "child"-element will be added to the selected
          database object with the default title "BTS Text" (in order to see it you might have to
          open the parent element, i.e. the TCObject or Text you chose in step 1).</li>
        <li>Name your text in the <xref href="ui_maintab.dita#concept_isp_k5f_yr">Main Tab</xref> of
          the Passport Editor (the "Name" input field will appear red until it is filled out). Until
          you do this the default name will be "BTS Text".</li>
        <li>Like with the Text Corpus Object define the Type and, if applicable, also the Subtype of
          the database object. Provide as much information as possible by filling out the different
          tabs of the <xref href="ui_passporteditor.dita">Passport Data Editor</xref>. The different
          Types are as follows:<p>
            <ul id="ul_hp1_jgp_3x">
              <li><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/text.png" id="image_hdk_ngp_3x"/>
                <b>Text:</b> A Text is defined as a coherent entity. Your physical object might
                contain several texts, e.g. Papyrus Harris 500 contains "The Doomed Prince", "The
                Taking of Joppe" etc. Each of these tales and poems receives its own database object
                "Text" subordinated to the TCObject "Papyrus Harris 500.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul id="ul_pwm_rwp_3x">
              <li><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/subtext.png" id="image_cb2_4gp_3x"/>
                <b>Subtext:</b> Subtexts are parts of the same text that are related to each other
                but lack a defined order of reading (e.g. different figures and their respective
                inscriptions on a relief).<p>NOTE: Do not treat chapters or captions of a continuous
                  text (e.g. the medical remedies in Papyrus Ebers) as subtexts. These have to be
                  segmented by annotations (see <xref href="howto_annotations.dita"/>).</p></li>
            </ul>
          </p></li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p><b>Naming a TCObject / text</b></p>
    <p>Creating a suitable name for each database object, in particular for the TCObject and the
      Text, is essential if you want to be able to quickly locate a specific text in the database.
      Select a concise name that is short and significant. If your text is known under different
      names only use one of them to name it, as you can enter synonyms in the Synonym tab of the
      Passport Data Editor (see <xref href="ui_synonyms.dita"/>), e.g. for the Text "Admonitions"
      you could also enter "Mahnworte des Ipuwer", "Klagen des Ipuwer", "The Dialogue of Ipuwer and
      the Lord of All" etc. as synonyms.</p>
    <p><b>Defining the visibility</b></p>
    <p>Define the visibility of your database object in the main tab of the <xref
        href="howto_passport.dita">Passport Editor</xref>. See also <xref href="user_roles.dita"
        >User Roles Description</xref>. A default visibility can be defined in the <xref
        href="ui_berlintextsystem.dita">Preferences</xref>.</p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_vrb_2tw_kx">
        <li>reader</li>
        <li>group</li>
        <li>project</li>
        <li>public</li>
        <li>all_authenticated</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>NOTE: The default visibility applies to all newly created database objects, which also
      includes annotations, rubra, comments etc. A change in the visibility status of a parent
      database object does not change the status of any of its children; i.e. if your default
      visibility is "reader", you have to manually change all TCObjects, Texts, annotations, rubra
      etc. to "public" once you want to publish your text in the TLA.</p>
    <p><b>Defining the review state</b></p>
    <p>The display icon of your Text Corpus Objects and Texts differs according to the review state
      you selected in the main tab of the <xref href="howto_passport.dita">passport editor</xref>. A
      default review state can be defined in the <xref href="ui_berlintextsystem.dita"
        >Preferences</xref>. The icons shown above will get one of the following additions:</p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_n52_nhq_3x">
        <li><image href="Images/Icons_updated/full/ovr16/new.png" id="image_bg2_phq_3x"/> new</li>
        <li><image href="Images/Icons_updated/full/ovr16/awaiting-review.png" id="image_bjh_qhq_3x"
          /> awaiting review</li>
        <li><image href="Images/Icons_updated/full/ovr16/awaiting-update.png" id="image_cmr_qhq_3x"
          /> awaiting update</li>
        <li><image href="Images/Icons_updated/full/ovr16/reviewed.png" id="image_ywm_rhq_3x"/>
          reviewed / published</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>NOTE: Like with visibility, the default review state applies to all newly created database
      objects, which includes annotations, rubra, comments etc. A change in the review state of a
      parent database object does not change the status of any of its children; i.e. if your default
      review state is "new", you have to manually change all TCObjects, Texts, annotations, rubra
      etc. to "published" once you want to publish your text in the TLA.</p>
    <p><b>Moving database objects (TCObjects / Texts)</b></p>
    <p>To change the physical location of a database object (marked in square brackets next to the
      name) from one project or corpus to another, right click the chosen item and select "Move
      among projects" from the menu. A window opens displaying the current physical location. Alter
      the entries as you wish (upper field to change the project and middle field for a corpus in
      the project) by clicking the checkbox in the lower field (see image below). Changing the
      physical location does not affect the position of the database object in the Navigator Tree.
      To change the database object's position in the Tree, you have to change its relationships in
      the <xref href="ui_relationstab.dita">"Relations" tab</xref> of the Passport Data Editor. </p>
    <p>NOTE: If you have accidentally created a database object in the wrong position and you do not
      have the rights to move it, please contact the administrator in Berlin: aegypt1@bbaw.de.</p>

        id="image_tqj_nyv_3x"/></p>
    <p><b>Deleting database objects (TCObjects/Texts)</b></p>
    <p>There are two options to delete a database object from the database:</p>
    <p>
      <ol id="ol_awf_h1x_3x">
        <li>To delete a database object (TCObjects or Texts) select it and then click on <image
            href="Images/icons/full/obj16/delete.png" id="image_ctd_3cw_ns"/> "Delete". It will be
          moved to the trash bin (<image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/bin.png" id="image_std_3cw_ns"
          />"Trash" tab in the Corpus Navigator), where you have the chance to restore it (right click
          the object and choose "Restore" from the menu) or to delete it permanently. All
          subordinate elements will be deleted as well. Upon closing or restarting the BTS all the
          items in the trash bin will be deleted permanently.</li>
        <li>A database object can be deleted permanently (without moving it to trash first) by
          either right-clicking the respective item and selecting "Delete Permanently" or by
          selecting the item from the Navigator Tree and then selecting "Delete Permanently" from
          the drop-down menu <image href="Images/icons/extra%20icons/options_dreieck.png"
            id="image_zj3_d2g_ys"/>. Clicking on "Delete Permanently" will open a confirmation box
          in which you can confirm (or reject) the deletion.</li>
      </ol>
