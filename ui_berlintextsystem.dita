  <title>Berlin Text System General</title>
  <body>
    <p>Expanding the "Berlin Text System General" will present the following options: </p>
    <p><b>Abstract Text Settings</b></p>
    <p><b>Configuration</b></p>
    <p>Currently the only available option is Altägyptisches Wörterbuch (AAEW) (10). Click "Apply"
      to use this configuration. Click "Restore Default" to go back to the default configuration. </p>
    <p><b>Corpus Settings</b></p>
    <p>Here you can choose a set of corpora you are going to work with. Every corpus that does not
      appear in the active corpora list on the right will not be accessed by BTS (this includes
      diaplay in the Navigator tree and search querries). To activate a corpus select it in the list
      on the left and then click "Add". To remove the corpus from your working list, select it and
      click Remove. Add all / Remove all will add or remove all available corpora to or from the
      active corpora list. </p>
    <p>The check-box "Activate to select main working corpus" has a specific function. If it is
      activated all new text or database objects created in the "Corpus Navigator" window will be
      physically saved in the selected corpus. For example in the Corpus Navigator you have selected
      Corpus 2, but your main working corpus is Corpus 1. The new database object will be
        <i>physically</i> saved in Corpus 1, although in the Corpus Navigator it is displayed as a
      part of Corpus 2. </p>
    <p><b>Corpus Navigator Settings </b></p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_ndc_wl2_vt">
        <li>Check box "Corpus Navigator sort by sort key". By default, all objects on the same level
          have "0" as a sort key and are thus sorted alphabetically. Defining a SortKey in the
          Passport data of the object will change its position regarding other objects, "0" being on
          top. See <xref href="ui_maintab.dita">Main Tab</xref>.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_egq_wl2_vt">
        <li>Default Visibility applies to all newly created objects. Defines a visibility status a
          corpus will have by default after its creation.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_fdd_xl2_vt">
        <li>Default Review State applies to all newly created objects. Like the "Default Visibility"
          above, this defines a review state which a corpus will have directly after its
          creation.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p><b>Lemma List Settings </b>
    </p>
    <p>Here you can choose a project with a main working lemma list. All new lemmas will be saved in
      this project. You can currently choose Altägyptisches Wörterbuch BBAW and Demotic. If you
      choose both, the combined lemma list will be displayed in "Lemma Navigator". If you work with
      texts in Demotic script, please select Demotic as main working lemma list. Otherwise, select
      Altägyptisches Wörterbuch BBAW.</p>
    <p><b>Lemma Navigator Settings</b></p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_gvc_vl2_vt">
        <li>Check box "Lemma Navigator sort by sort key". Per default all objects on the same level
          have "0" as a sort key and are thus sorted alphabetically. Defining a "SortKey" in the
          Passport data of the object will change its position relevant to other objects, "0" being
          on top. </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_uy3_vl2_vt">
        <li>Default Visibility applies to all newly created objects. Defines a visibility status a
          lemma will have by default after its creation.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_ylp_vl2_vt">
        <li>Default Review State applies to all newly created objects. Like the "Default Visibility"
          above, this defines a review state which a lemma will have directly after its
          creation.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>NOTE: Default Visibilty and Default Review State apply to all newly created database objects,
      also including  annotations, rubra, comments etc. Currenly there is no feature available to
      apply changes in the visibilty and review state to child elements. That means, if e.g. your
      default visibility is "reader", you have to change all TCObjects, Texts, annotations, rubra
      etc. to "public" manually once you want to publish your text in the TLA.</p>
    <p><b>Lemmatizer</b>
    </p>
    <p>The Lemmatizer allows you to set a default inflection (the programmes default inflection is
      "3") and activate the check box "Automatically select first lemma proposal". The latter
      feature enables you to navigate through the proposed lemmata via the arrow keys of you
      keyboard. More on grammatical rules see <xref
        href="grammar_rules.dita#topic_f5w_3z5_kr">BTS Grammar Rules - Reference</xref>. </p>
    <p><b>Project settings</b>
    </p>
    <p>Here you can choose your main working project from the drop-down menu. The field below gives
      you an option to choose further projects from which you want to load and read data. In the box
      on the left is a list of available projects. Clicking on one will give you an option to add it
      to the "Projects to be downloaded" on the right. Clicking on Apply below will download the
      project. Between the two fields you also have an option to remove the project from the right
      field and to "Add All" from available to to-be-downloaded and "Remove All" from
      to-be-downloaded to available. Next to the "Apply" button there is also one that will restore
      default settings "Restore Default".</p>
    <p><b>Remember me</b></p>
    <p>Select the check box "Remember my login credentials on startup" to be logged in
      automatically, when starting BTS. To deactivate this function unselect the check box.</p>
    <p><b>Text Editor</b></p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_nwm_zl2_vt">
        <li>Activate mouse-over pop-up with information on lemmata. Activating this option will
          display the lemmatization information about the selected lemma in the Text editor
          (currently unavailable).</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_ewz_zl2_vt">
        <li>Show line number ruler on left side. This check box activates the line numbering (of the
          window) in the <xref href="ui_texteditor_e10.dita#concept_f4v_hqm_mr">Text
            editor</xref>. </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p><b>Sign Text Editor </b></p>
    <p>Defines the elements displayed in the lemma-boxes while editing tokens inside the Sign Text
      Editor. Additionally, the line width can be adjusted by changing the number in the "Line width
      in pixel" input field.</p>
    <p>The applied changes will be visible upon refreshing the view of the "Sign Text Editor" tab. </p>
    <p>NOTE: The function "Line width in pixel" does not work in the current version.</p>
    <p><b>Thesaurus Settings</b>
    </p>
    <p>Here you can choose a project with a main working thesaurus. All new thesaurus entries will
      be saved there. Currently only one working thesaurus is available "Altägyptisches Wörterbuch
      BBAW".</p>
    <p><b>Thesaurus Navigator Settings</b></p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_dn2_bm2_vt">
        <li>Check box "Ths Navigator sort by sort key". Per default all objects on the same level
          have "0" as a sort key and are thus sorted alphabetically. Defining a "SortKey" in the
          Passport data of the object will change its position relevant to other objects, "0" being
          on top. </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_ojn_bm2_vt">
        <li>Default Visibility applies to all newly created objects. Defines a visibility status a
          thesaurus entry will have by default after its creation.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_mfc_cm2_vt">
        <li>Default Review State applies to all newly created objects. Like the Default Visibility
          above, this defines a review state which a thesaurus entry will have directly after its
          creation.</li>
