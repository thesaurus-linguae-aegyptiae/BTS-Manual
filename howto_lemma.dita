  <title>Creating a lemma entry</title>
  <body>
    <p>This option is only available to users with researcher privileges for the lemma-list. If you
      have a new lemma, which is not yet present in the BTS lemma list, please send a proposal to
      the BTS team via E-mail: aegypt1@bbaw.de.</p>
    <p>
      <ol id="ol_v31_3nw_ns">
        <li>To create a new lemma, open the <xref href="ui_lemmanaview.dita">Lemma
            View</xref>. On the left you will see the <xref
            href="ui_lemmanavigator.dita#concept_pgn_j4d_4r">Lemma Navigator</xref>: a
          list of available lemmata, grouped alphabetically.</li>
        <li>Click on <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/lemmata.png" id="image_n2f_2zw_dx"/> in
          the Lemma Navigator toolbar.</li>
        <li>In the <xref href="ui_lemma_lemmaeditor.dita#concept_atc_z4d_4r">Lemma Editor</xref> add
          a transliteration for your lemma (see below). </li>
        <li>In the text-input field below you may also add hieroglyphs. In order to do that, open
          the <xref href="ui_htw.dita#concept_qmv_p2b_sr">Hieroglyph Type Writer
            (HTW)</xref> and follow the instructions on how to enter hieroglyphs for a text.</li>
        <li>In the text-input field below, enter a translation for your lemma (choosing the language
          of your translation beforehand).</li>
        <li>Add information on transliteration, part of speech, review state in the main tab of the
          Passport Editor.</li>
        <li>Add a bibliographical reference in the <xref
            href="ui_lemma_passporteditor.dita#concept_ws4_2pd_4r">Passport
          Editor</xref>.</li>
        <li>To add an annotation or a comment to a lemma, click <image
            href="Images/icons/full/icon16/annotation-add.png" id="image_yky_5vm_wr"/> "Add
          Annotation" and <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/comment-add.png"
            id="image_st5_vvm_wr"/> "Add Comment" in the toolbar of the Lemma Navigator.</li>
        <li>To delete a lemma entry, use the <image href="Images/icons/full/obj16/delete.png"
            id="image_xdl_2wm_wr"/> "Move to Trash" entry in the Lemma Navigator context menu. It will move the
          entry to the "Trash" tab, where you can manually delete it permanently. Closing or
          restarting the BTS will also lead to the permanent deletion of any entry in the trash bin.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Transliteration</b></p>
    <p>The lemma transliteration section is identical to <xref
        href="ui_texteditor_e10.dita#concept_f4v_hqm_mr">Text Editor</xref>. Transliterate the lemma
      in this field within the "§" signs ("§" marks the beginning and the end of the lemma). If the
      transliteration is not enclosed with "§", it will not be valid. </p>
    <p><b>Compound-word-lemmata:</b> If you want to enter a lemma that consists of multiple words
      (e.g. as in <i>m-ẖnw</i>), use "-" between each element. If you want to split them into
      multiple elements (but have it as one entry) then just use "space" between each word. Do not
      enclose each word individually with "§". </p>
    <p>The consequence of splitting the compounds into multiple elements is that in the case of
      searching for a part of the compound (e.g. "<i>ḥm</i>" in the case of <i>ḥm-nṯr</i>) the
      evidence of the token lemmatized as compound will appear.</p>
    <p>Example: "<i>m-ẖnw</i>": Typing §<i>m-ẖnw</i>§ marks one element while §<i>m ẖnw</i>§ marks
      two elements: <i>m</i> and <i>ẖnw</i> (wrong: §<i>m</i>§ §<i>ẖnw</i>§).</p>
    <p><b>Sign-Text</b></p>
    <p>In the Sign-Text section every lemma appears as a single element, no matter if the element is
      part of a compound word or not. This means that you can sub-lemmatize every part of a compound
      in addition to the compound itself (which would be lemmatized as one lemma only).</p>
    <p><b>Translation</b></p>
    <p>Enter the translation for the complete lemma into this field. Select the language of your
      choice by left-clicking the drop-down menu marked by <image
        href="Images/icons/full/icon16/locale.png" id="image_jwn_h5c_qr"/>. </p>
