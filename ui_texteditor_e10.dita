 <title>Text Editor</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>The Text Editor window is located in the upper part in the middle of the Text Corpus view. It
   enables you to create IT-readable editions of texts and subtexts according to BTS standards. The
   Text editor is only active after you have selected a text / subtext in the Text Corpus Navigator.
   Now you can start to edit your text / subtext. The Text Editor offers you the possibility to
   transliterate your text / subtext (Transliteration tab), to translate it sentence by sentence
   (translation field) and to enrich the transliteration with hieroglyphs (HTW tab). The Sign Text
   Editor displays a detailed view of the properties of every token of your transliteration and is
   needed together with the Lemmatizer for the process of lemmatization.</p>
  <p>This chapter provides a general description of the window. For a step-by-step instruction of
   how to enter a new text please refer to the relevant <xref
    href="howto_edittext2.dita#topic_k3c_35y_qt">chapter</xref> in the User Guide section of this
   manual. </p>
  <p>The Text Editor section contains two input fields. The upper one displays either the
   "Transliteration", the "Sign Text Editor" or the "JSesh View" - depending on the tab selected.
   The lower input field displays translation of the sentence, selected with the cursor in the upper
   window. </p>

  <p><b>Transliteration</b></p>
  <p>Here you can enter or modify the transliteration of the text which you previously selected in
   the corpora tree. Beware of the <xref href="grammar_rules.dita#topic_f5w_3z5_kr">BTS
    Grammar Rules</xref>, otherwise the auto-checker system will trigger an error, marked by a red
   square and underlined red. </p>
  <p><b>Sign Text Editor </b></p>
  <p>The "Sign-Text-Editor" provides the token-based presentation of the text. Initially only the
   transliteration is displayed there - each word / lemma in a separate box. The Lemma ID, the
   inflection code, the Lemma Translation and hieroglyphs of each token can be made visible via menu
   entry  "Preferences / Preferences / Berlin Text System General / Text Editor / Sign Text Editor". </p>
  <p>The hieroglyphic input is done in the <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/hieroglyphetw.png"
    id="image_ok5_nlw_nr"/> Hieroglyph Type Writer tab below. The hieroglyphic values, entered
   there, are automatically applied to the selected lemmata in the "Sign-Text-Editor" sub-tab.
   Additionally to the transcription and hieroglyphs, a lemma number and inflection code will be
   displayed in each word box after a successful lemmatization.</p>
  <p><b>JSesh View</b></p>
  <p>Displays a cohesive hieroglyphic text. "dot" marks the end of the sentence (signified in
   "Transliteration" and "Sign Text Editor" tabs with "§" sign). Due to technical reasons only short
   texts are currently displayed correctly.</p>
  <p><b>Toolbar of the Text Editor</b></p>
  <p>There are several buttons in the toolbar above the "Text-Editor" window. They can be used in
   all three tabs "Transliteration", "Sign Text Editor", and "JSesh View". We recommand to use them
   only in the "Translitaration"-tab as we do not garantee full functionality for the other
   tabs.</p>
  <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/lemma-load.png" id="image_sws_dns_mr"/>
   <u>Load Text Lemmata </u></p>
  <p>Loads word and sentence borders of your texts in order to be able to add a translation and to
   lemmatize the words and add the hieroglyphs in the next steps. Click this button after
   transliteration has been finished.</p>
  <p>NOTE: This does not save your transliteration.</p>
  <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/chcecklemmata.png" id="image_glp_wld_vt"/><u>Check Text
    Lemmata, Flexcodes...</u>
  </p>
  <p>Checks the completeness of text lemmatization, translation and hieroglyphic transcription. </p>
  <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/annotation-add.png" id="image_ixh_g4s_mr"/>
   <u>Add Annotation </u></p>
  <p>Adds an <xref href="howto_annotations.dita">Annotation</xref> to the selected part of your
   text. It will be underlined with a gray dotted line. </p>
  <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/rubrum-add.png" id="image_gwm_dqs_mr"/>
   <u>Add Rubrum </u></p>
  <p>The active token is marked red in the text as rubrum.</p>
  <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/subtext-add.png" id="image_zxr_pqs_mr"/>
   <u>Add Glosses</u></p>
  <p>Adds a gloss respectively as a "child" of your text. You can edit it separately.</p>
  <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/comment-add.png" id="image_d5g_krs_mr"/>
   <u>Add Comment </u></p>
  <p>Adds a comment to the selected part. It will be underlined yellow.</p>
  <p>You can use these functions also via the drop-down menu that appears when you click on the arrow
   on the right. </p>
  <p>Additionally, for Annotations, Rubra and Comments, a small, rectangular bar will appear on the
   right side of the Text-Editor with the corresponding colour. Clicking on the bar will bring you
   to the marked segment of the text. </p>
  <p><b>Sentence translation</b></p>
  <p>At the bottom of the Text Editor tab there is a text-input field where you can enter a
   translation of every sentence. With the existing transliteration it is deactivated unless a lemma
   has been selected in the "Text editor" or until you click somewhere into the sentence. With the
   new transliteration it is greyed out until you press "Load Text Lemmata" - after this the
   text-input field will be activated. Note that you have to switch the keyboard layout from "AAeW"
   to standard to enter the translation.</p>
  <p>The translation can be entered and modified in all three tabs "Transliteration", "Sign Text
   Editor", and "JSesh View". </p>
  <p>The <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/locale.png" id="image_plt_3yt_mr"/> "Languages" icon
   offers a drop-down menu with a number of languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Russian) to
   choose from. Choose the language of your translation.</p>
