  <title>Creating a thesaurus entry</title>
  <body>
    <p>This option is available to users with researcher privileges for the thesaurus. If you have a
      new thesaurus entry, which is not yet present in the BTS thesaurus list, please send a
      proposal to the BTS team via E-mail: aegypt1@bbaw.de.</p>
    <p>The main function of the Thesaurus is to provide controlled vocabulary for the metadata of
      texts, (physical) objects, lemma entries and thesaurus entries, e.g. dating, location or
      material. For a detailed description of the individual elements of the Thesaurus view see
        <xref href="ui_thesaurus.dita"/>.</p>
    <p>
      <ol id="ol_sb3_xvx_st">
        <li>Open the Thesaurus view by clicking the <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/thss.png"
            id="image_fck_tgj_cs"/> "Thesaurus" icon in the <xref
            href="ui_toolbar_e3.dita#topic_ejn_sdy_lr">Toolbar</xref>.</li>
        <li>In the Thesaurus Navigator on the left, click either <image
            href="Images/icons/full/icon16/thss_add.png" id="image_vbs_52k_qr"/> "Add Thesaurus Root
          Entry" or <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/ths-add.png" id="image_v3d_w2k_qr"/> "Add
          Thesaurus Child Entry" to create a new thesaurus entry. A root entry may stand on its own,
          while a child entry is always dependent on the root entry. </li>
        <li>Click on the newly created "Thesaurus" entry to edit its content. Its Passport Editor
            <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/passport.png" id="image_ott_5fk_qr"/> will appear
          in the middle.</li>
        <li>In the Passport Editor you have to type a name (default name is either "Thesaurus Root"
          or "Thesaurus Child"), define type and subtype via the drop-down menus and edit visibility
          and review status. </li>
        <li>Now fill in all available metadata into the Passport Editor. For a detailed description
          of the individual tabs and elements of the passport editor of the Thesaurus View, see
            <xref href="ui_thesaurus_passporteditor.dita"/>.</li>
        <li>To add an annotation or a comment to a Thesaurus entry, click <image
            href="Images/icons/full/icon16/annotation-add.png" id="image_yky_5vm_wr"/> "Add
          Annotation" and <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/comment-add.png"
            id="image_st5_vvm_wr"/> "Add Comment" in the toolbar of the Thesaurus Navigator.</li>
        <li>To delete a thesaurus entry, use the <image href="Images/icons/full/obj16/delete.png"
            id="image_xdl_2wm_wr"/> "Move to Trash" button in the Thesaurus Navigator context menu. It will move
          the entry to the "Trash" tab, where you can manually delete it permanently. Closing or
          restarting the BTS will also lead to the permanent deletion of any entry in the trash bin.</li>
      </ol>
