  <p><b>Annotations</b></p>
  <p>The Annotations tab can contain the following elements : </p>
  <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/annotation.png" id="image_p3k_pz3_sr"/> Annotation</p>
  <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/rubrum.png" id="image_fjn_yz3_sr"/> Rubrum</p>
  <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/comment.png" id="image_qrx_zz3_sr"/> Comment</p>
  <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/subtext.png" id="image_mck_31j_sr"/>
   Glosse<?oxy_custom_start type="oxy_content_highlight" color="255,198,140"?></p>
  <?oxy_custom_end?>
  <p>Clicking one of them will display their content. The related textpart will be marked in
   "Transliteration" tab with different colours: bright red for Rubra; yellow for comments; gray for
   Annotations and blue for Glosses. The underlining of the related segment in the text will appear
   thicker. Additionally, for Annotations, Rubra and Comments, a small rectangle will appear next to
   the scroll bar of the Text Editor with the corresponding colour. Clicking on the rectangle will
   bring you to the marked segment of the text. </p>
  <p>Each annotation, rubrum, comment and gloss contains a toolbar with the following buttons:</p>
  <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/chain-add.png" id="image_ult_dv3_sr"/> Add Current Text
   Selection as Reference</p>
  <p>The selected text part is referenced to the current annotation, rubrum, element and gloss. This
   feature provides an opportunity, for example, to reference multiple text parts to a single
   annotation.</p>
  <p>The following buttons can be used to connect the existing comments, annotations, rubra and
   subtexts/glosses to other parts of the text: </p>
  <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/chain-edit.png" id="image_zwn_fv3_sr"/> Update Current
   Reference</p>
  <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/chain-delete.png" id="image_zjx_hv3_sr"/> Remove Current
   Reference </p>
  <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/edit.png" id="image_jjk_l5t_mr"/> Edit Comment or Edit

   "Relations" tab. </p>

   or edit a title for your comment in the upper input field and the content of your comment in the
   lower input field. Below there is also a section where you can see or edit a relation of the
   comment to the text, using the ID.</p>

   <u>Delete</u>: Will delete the currently selected element.</p>
  <p>To learn more about annotations refer to the <xref href="howto_annotations.dita">"Annotations"
    section</xref> in the "User guide". </p>
  <p><b>Text translation</b></p>
  <p>The "Text translation" section shows a consequent, sentence-by-sentence, translation, which
   makes a continuous proofreading possible. The  drop-down menu "Languages" <image
    href="Images/icons/full/icon16/locale.png" id="image_w1q_vm3_ns"/>allows to select a translation
   in the relevant languages. Sentences which have not been translated yet are marked as "## no
   trans: de ##§" / "## no trans: en ##§" etc. A click on a sentence highlights the sentence in the
   "Sign text editor", in the "Transliteration" tabs, and in the "Sentence translation" input field.
   A typo or another problem observed in the continuous translation can be altered in the "Sentence
   translation" input field.</p>
