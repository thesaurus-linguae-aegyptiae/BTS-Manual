  <title>Adjusting display</title>
  <body>
    <p>The location and display of individual tabs within BTS is flexible, but such changes in the
      display and arrangement of tabs cannot be saved, as every restart of BTS restores the default
      organisation.</p>
    <p><b>Minimizing/Maximizing</b></p>
    <p>Most tabs can be minimized/maximized by clicking the buttons: <image
        href="Images/icons/extra%20icons/minimize.png" id="image_mry_1y2_1v"/> and <image
        href="Images/icons/extra%20icons/maximize.png" id="image_bns_by2_1v"/>, respectively. When
      you have maximized/minimized one or several tabs of the Workspace (Corpus Navigator, Text
      Editor etc.), their respective icons will appear on the right or left side of the program
      window (see image below). For explanations of the icons see <xref href="ui_window.dita"/>. To
      restore minimized tabs, click on the <image href="Images/icons/extra%20icons/restore.png"
        id="image_eyc_dff_1v"/> icon; clicking on "Open Text Editor" etc. in "Window" in the Menu
      bar is another way of restoring these tabs. Clicking on the tab's icons while the tab is
      minimized will open a small window for that tab, which can then be closed by clicking on the
      icon again. </p>
    <p>This example shows the maximized Text Editor; other tabs are minimized and their icons
      displayed on the right and left (marked by a red rectangle). </p>

    <p><b>Closing Tabs</b></p>
    <p>Apart from the Navigator Tree, most of the tabs can be closed by clicking <image
        href="Images/icons/extra%20icons/close.png" id="image_hfc_l2t_2x"/>. You can restore the
      closed tab via the dropdown menu "Window" in the Menu bar. Restarting BTS will also restore
      all closed tabs.</p>
    <p><b>Moving tabs</b></p>
    <p>If you do not like the default arrangement of the BTS tabs, most of them can be moved (some
      have to stay together, like all the sub-tabs of the Text Editor [Transliteration, Sign Text
      Editor, and JSesh View], all the sub-tabs of the Passport Editor, and the sub-tabs of the
      Corpus Navigator [Text Corpora and Trash]). You can grab a tab and pull it to a different
      location within the Workspace. Below is an example of rearranged sections; Annotations have
      been moved next to the Corpus Navigator, Translation is placed below it, and Text Editor is no
      longer central. </p>

        id="image_xxg_pgf_1v"/></p>
    <p>It is also possible to pull an entire tab completely out of the program window. See
      screenshot below for an example. Tabs that have been removed from the program and now have
      individual windows cannot be put back into the main program window; to do this you have to
      restart BTS.</p>
    <p>NOTE: When you remove the last window from the program window, all windows will disappear. You
      need to restart BTS to restore the display.</p>
